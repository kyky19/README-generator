  ## Description
  This project allows users to create a README file via the command line using node.
  
  ## Usage
  Users must clone the project, and while in the folder run "npm i" or "npm install". Then, users must run node index.js to be prompted with the first question. Users must answer all questions, or else met with a message alerting them to answer the questions. Once all questions are answered, the inputs will be stored into a new created, styled, README file.
